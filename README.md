# UCSDSoundTopography

A project for my MUS1A class at UCSD.

The goal was to create a sound map of some place on the UCSD campus. I walked down Library Walk at a continuous pace,
recording the sounds on my phone. I did some signal processing, got values for things like amplitude, pitch, etc., and
outputted that data into an ascii STL file to 3d print.

Check inside the /images folder for some images of the final prints.
